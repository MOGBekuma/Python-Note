# What is Python
Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization.

# Variables in  Python
Python Variable is containers which store values. Python is not “statically typed”. We do not need to declare variables before using them or declare their type. A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it. A Python variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.

Rules for creating variables in Python
+A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
+A variable name cannot start with a number.
+A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
+Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variables).
+The reserved words(keywords) cannot be used naming the variable.

  Python Variable Types are.....
+Numbers.
+String.
+List.
+Tuple.
